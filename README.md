# SleeperDraftOrderFetcher-
SleeperDraftOrderFetcher is a Python script that uses the Sleeper API to determine the draft order for future years in a Sleeper dynasty fantasy football league. It takes into account the current Max PF standings of the league and outputs the draft order for future seasons and shows who currently has each pick. 

Sleeper API Documentation: https://docs.sleeper.com/#introduction

This script currently only sorts draft order by Max PF.
